## Welcome to EDGI's GitHub onboarding!
If you're looking to check out projects that are meant to be set up as a local environment, then please complete this onboarding before doing so.

This tutorial will help you understand how Git works, and how you can check out and work on any EDGI project yourself!

A prerequisite for this is that you need a GitHub account, and you **must** be part of EDGI's GitHub organization. Reach out to someone if you need help for this! Once this is set up, you can continue with the setup on your computer:

1. **Install Git.** Go to Git's site at https://git-scm.com/downloads, and follow the instructions to install git on your computer.
2. **Install Python.** Go to Python's site at https://www.python.org/downloads/, and install Python on your computer. **Important: When installing, make sure to tick the option to add Python to the PATH.** This will ensure that when you use python commands from your computer's terminal, it will work properly.

3. **Install GitHub Desktop.** Go to GitHub Desktop's site at https://desktop.github.com/download/ and install it. This program makes it easy to look at all the repositories you've installed.
4. Open GitHub Desktop and connect your GitHub account to it. Once you're logged in, hit File -> Clone Repository. Copy the URL for this repository and paste it into GitHub Desktop, make sure it's cloning to a place you like on your computer, and hit Clone! **Important: Try to avoid cloning to a cloud folder - in many cases the "default" folder GitHub chooses is inside another cloud provider's service, like OneDrive or iCloud. This can cause headaches with syncing your repository's contents between different PCs.**
5. Now that this repository is cloned on your computer, open PowerShell (or Terminal if you're a Mac user). Use the "cd" command ("change directory") to move to your "github-onboarding" folder, i.e. where this repository is located on your computer.
