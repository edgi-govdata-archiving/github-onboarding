    "\n",
    "To do that, we'll use the `requirements.txt` file in this repository. This file lists all the Python packages needed to run the code in this notebook. We'll install these packages directly into a Python virtual environment to keep them separate from your system Python installation. Please reference the `README.md` file for more detailed instructions on how to set up your environment.\n",

    "Once the Python packages have been installed, you can run the cells in this notebook. You may need to select the Python kernel that this notebook should use, if you haven't already done so. Choose the kernel that corresponds to the virtual environment you created. For help with this, we recommend Googling \"how to select a Python notebook kernel in \\<your editor\\>\" (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter, etc.).\n",

    "Once your change is made, you can commit and push your changes to your branch, by either using git in the command line or GitHub desktop. After that, you can open a Pull Request (PR) to merge your changes into the main branch of the repository. An admin on this repo will review your PR and merge it if everything looks good!"
